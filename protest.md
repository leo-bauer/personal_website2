## Scraping Data on Peaceful Revolution Protest in East Germany

The scraper allows you to download event-level data on protest that happened as part of the 1989-1990 Peaceful Revolution in the German Democratic Republic. The resulting data set has the individual protest event as the unit of analysis and records information on a range of variables. These are date, location, number of participants, organizing entity and more.  

A more technical description of the project as well as the code for the scraper can be found [here](https://github.com/leo-bauer/gdr-protest-scraper){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. The code is written for a Linux OS, but should work on other operating systems with minimal changes to the portion of the code that initializes the webdriver.
