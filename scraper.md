## An Introduction to Webscraping

This workshop covers the basics of scraping text data from the web using Python. A short introduction to HTML page structure and setting up Python will open the workshop. Then, we will go through the process of selecting HTML elements from an existing website, writing code to scrape text and putting it into a structured dataset. Specific attention will be given to the BeautifulSoup4 and Selenium packages and browser automation with Geckodriver. The aim is that participants can start scraping simple websites after the workshop with the help of materials provided, and based thereon learn to collect data from more complex sites.

Materials coming soon!
