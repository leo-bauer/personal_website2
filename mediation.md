## Mediation in Self-Determination Disputes Dataset

Led by Dr. David Cunningham, the NSF-funded Mediation in Self-Determination Disputes Dataset (MSDD) project aims at collecting data on mediation events on self-determination disputes. While existing data projects have collected data mainly on conflict mediation during hostilities, we do so for longer periods of time during which a self-determination dispute persists. Hence, we gather data on dispute mediation both during and absent violent conflict.

To collect data we rely on newspaper article databases, use machine learning to improve search results and employ human coders to code mediation events for the MSDD. Event data are collected for a 25-year time period on a global sample of several dozen self-determination disputes. Ultimately, with the MSDD we aim to understand whether and under what conditions mediation efforts can prevent civil wars from breaking out.
