## Mediation in Self-Determination Disputes Dataset

Led by David Cunningham, the NSF-funded Mediation in Self-Determination Disputes Dataset (MSDD) project collected data on mediation events on self-determination disputes. While existing data projects have collected data mainly on conflict mediation during hostilities, we did so for longer periods of time during which a self-determination dispute persists. Hence, we gathered data on dispute mediation both during and absent violent conflict. This approach allows us to better understand whether and under what conditions mediation efforts can prevent civil wars from breaking out.

To identify mediation event data for the MSDD we relied on newspaper article databases, used a machine learning model to classify search results and employed human coders to code mediation events from the resulting set of news articles. We collected event data for a 25-year time period on a global sample of self-determination disputes. Ultimately, we were able to identify 1,317 mediation events for 53 disputes, spanning 1,325 dispute-years. We plan on making the MSDD publicly available soon.
