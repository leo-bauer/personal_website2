## Scraping the Archive of German Far-right Weekly Junge Freiheit

This project came to fruition in the fall of 2020 in collaboration with [Christian Czymara](https://czymara.com){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. The Python scraper lets you download articles by volume (all issues in one calendar year) from the archive of Germanyâ€™s biggest far-right weekly by circulation, Junge Freiheit.

The archive covers the time period from 1997 to the present, with new issues being uploaded with a several-week lag. The scraped data have individual articles as observations. Variables recorded for each article are date, title, the URL and the text.

A more technical description of the project as well as the code for the scraper can be found [here](https://github.com/leo-bauer/junge-freiheit-scraper){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}. Instructions and code on how to integrate the browser extension are written for Windows. Let me know if you need code to run the scraper using a Linux OS.
