## Teaching

I have been the teaching assistant for my department's graduate-level applied social data science class in Fall 2023. In addition, I have given guest lectures on environmental politics in Germany for two undergraduate classes in the 2022-2023 academic year.

I have also given several methods workshops as part of my department's graduate methods workshop series. You can find the workshop materials below. Further, I am the graduate methods workshop coordinator for the 2023-2024 academic year, organizing ten workshops by and for graduate students on a broad range of quantitative and qualitative methods.
