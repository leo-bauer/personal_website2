## Teaching

I have given two methods workshops as part of the University of Maryland Department of Government and Politics graduate methods workshop series. You can find the workshop materials below. I am also going to be the graduate methods workshop coordinator for the 2023-2024 academic year, organizing roughly a dozen workshops by and for graduate students on a broad range of quantitative methods. 

## Workshops

* [A Very Short Introduction to LaTeX](/latex): A concise workshop on creating scientific documents with LaTeX.

* [An Introduction to Webscraping](/scraper): A short workshop on how to collect and store data from webpages using Python.
