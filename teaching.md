## Teaching

I am the teaching assistant for my department's graduate-level applied social data science class in Fall 2023. In addition, I have given two guest lectures in the 2022-2023 academic year on environmental politics in Germany.

I have also given two methods workshops as part of my department's graduate methods workshop series. You can find the workshop materials below. Further, I am the graduate methods workshop coordinator for the 2023-2024 academic year, organizing roughly a dozen workshops by and for graduate students on a broad range of quantitative methods.
